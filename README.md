SNPSelection
Functions to select SNPs with the most information from raw files and combine results. Welcome to SNPSelection package! This package is mainly used to select the SNP with the highest information content for chip design. Using the fuction location_sel_SNP(SNP number you want).For help, please contact: lxb@yzu.edu.cn You need to provide all the raw files and map files (--maf 0.05 --geno 0) that are generated by plink (In the running directory!!!) and remove the first line and the first six columns of the raw file. The following commands are recommended ##Plink After splitting the chromosomes, maf0.05 and detection rate 100%, each generates a raw file. For dairy cows: for chr in {1..29}; do plink --bfile data --chr $chr --recodeA --maf 0.05 --geno 0 --out data_chr$chr done #################### #!/bin/bash find . -type f -name "*.raw" | while read -r file; do tmpfile=$(mktemp) awk 'NR > 1 {for (i=7; i<=NF; i++) printf "%s%s", $i, (i==NF?ORS:OFS)}' "$file" > "$tmpfile" mv "$tmpfile" "$file" done
